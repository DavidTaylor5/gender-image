# gender-image
A project in which I determine gender based on profile pictures

Currently this project cannot be run, the profile images are part of a nondisclosure agreement. I'm not allowed to distributed the private data online.
I can however talk more in depth about the data and demonstrate in a private setting.

Run imgGender.py to run convolutional neural network over 'good' preprocessed profile images.
